Introduction
------------

**docknv** (for *Docker with environments*) is a wrapper around
*Docker*, *Docker Compose* and *Docker Swarm*.

Here are the features:

-  **Environment configuration management**: you can define environment
   configuration files, to easily set and use values.
-  **Templating system**: you can insert your defined environment values
   in templates all over your volumes files, using the powerful Jinja2
   template engine.
-  **Mix Compose files**: you can easily merge classic Docker Compose
   templates together.
-  **Use schemas and namespaces to isolate**: you can isolate portions
   of infrastructure to build and run services independently.
-  **Concurrent executions**: on a single host, and from the same entry
   point, you can deploy multiple schemas in different namespaces.
-  **Custom commands**: you can extend the docknv command system to
   include your own custom commands and execute any action within
   docknv.
